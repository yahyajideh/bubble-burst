# Bubble Burst

I created this game **to apply what I have recently learned** in JS, CSS and HTML.

## How to play?

Burst the bubbles!!! Don't make me make a tutorial on how to play!!! Just burst (click) as many bubbles within the specified time each level. As you progress with the levels, the timer gets quicker AND the bubbles rise quicker! ðŸ˜Ž
